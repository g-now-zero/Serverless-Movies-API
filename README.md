# Serverless-Movies-API

## Objective:
- Create an API with serverless functions that shows movie information.

## Planning steps:
### 1. Map out cloud infrastructure
Requirements:
- SDK to set up cloud infra
- NoSQL database, cloud storage and serverless functions
### 2. Data preparation
Requirements:
- Find movie data to be stored in the cloud NoSQL db
- Store movie cover images of each movie in cloud storage
### 3. Create serverless functions
- GetMovies: Returns a JSON list of all movies in db *response should have a url of the movie cover
- GetMoviesByYear: Returns a list of movies released in a specified year *year should be provided by client
- GetMovieSummary: Return a summary generated by AI for a specified movie.

## Infrastructure planning
**Cloud service provider**: *Azure*
- Considerations: Choosing due to familiarity and to take advantage of Student Account

**Azure Functions**: HTTP-triggered functions for the three end points
- Considerations: Pay-per-execution model which will work out well for resources

**Azure Cosmos DB**: NoSQL database for movie information

**Blob Storage**: cost-effective storage for storing the movie covers and each image gets a public url

**Azure OpenAI Service**: For the summary generation *which will connect to GetMovieSummary function

## Deployment Strategy
### Docker Container Setup
Container includes all necessary tools and data for deployment:
- Terraform (IaC)
- Azure CLI
- Project data (images and movie information)
- Deployment scripts

### Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)
Handles core Azure resource creation:
- Resource groups
- Cosmos DB account
- Blob Storage account
- Function Apps
- API Management service

## Data Structure Design
- Year-based documents with alphabetical subgrouping
```json
{
    "id": "year_2008",
    "year": 2008,
    "t": {
        "movies": [
            {
                "title": "The Dark Knight",
                "genre": "Action",
                "year": 2008
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

#### Query flow
GetMovies:
-> Scan year documents, combine all alphabet sections

GetMoviesByYear:
-> Single document fetch by year

GetMovieSummary:
-> Year + alphabetical section lookup

## Deployment Strategy
**Azure CLI/Terraform docker container**: volume mounting if needed for any local file uploads

## Dataset
Choosing a small dataset for testing and functionality. Can scale if need be.
